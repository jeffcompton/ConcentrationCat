PRIVACY POLICY

Concentration Cat is an app that allows you to play a concentration-style memory game based on a photo album in your device's photo library.

To play this game you will need to give the app permission to access the photo library on your device. The photos will be accessed only while the app is running, and only for the the purpose of playing the game. The photos will not be transmitted to a remote server or stored anywhere else on your device.

No signup is required to use the app. Except for accessing your photos while the app is running for the purpose of displaying them, the app does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.

This policy is subject to change in future releases of the app.
